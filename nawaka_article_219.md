 The boats arrived, the tents were put up and all the participants put on their Subcamp uniforms. It was finally the time to welcome everyone at Nawaka with our Opening Ceremony!
 



 The crowd gathered together in boats all the way to the Town Hall Square and the pier of Zeewolde became the most colourful place in the Netherlands. With plenty of water fights, we kept ourselves as cool as possible, despite the high temperature above 30 degrees.
 



 More than 4.000 seascouts were welcomed by the mayor of Zeewolde, Gerrit Jan Gorter who was wishing us a wonderful time for the days to come. The ceremony continued with the musical duo 'Sjors & Eef'. They sang the theme song 'Ondersteboven' (Upside Down) that was written especially for Nawaka. Sjors & Eef are Sea Scouts who like to create music and to perform in their free time.
 



 Nawaka is divided into eight subcamps. Each age group has its own subcamp, colour, and its own identity. The scouts and different colours gave Zeewolde a charming face for a day. Scouting can bring smiles to everyoneâ€™s face!
